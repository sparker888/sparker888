## Light. Speed.✨: In Action

Welcome to the fifth installment of my **Light. Speed. Series!** In the [previous article](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-4), we explored Astro—a framework known for simplicity and performance—as a perfect marketing site build tool that fits neatly inside Jamstack architecture. Now with the launch of Astro 5, development is even more streamlined, with updated features that make building high-performance sites easier than ever. On top of that, Tailwind just launched their new version 4. Let's check out how I redesigned my Gravital Digital landing page with them!

### In need of an update, I rebuilt the [Gravital Digital](https://gravitaldigital.com/) landing page to harness:

**Astro’s version 5**—with partial hydration and server-side rendering improvements, perfect for high performance sites.

**Tailwind CSS version 4**—bundled with Astro 5 by default, featuring updated utilities and color palettes, perfect for modern styling and clean, maintainable codebases.

**Optimized AI videos** for inexpensive website visuals (originally generated with Sora and Kling AI 1.6), and compressed via HandBrake to keep page load times as low as possible.

**Multiple TailwindUI composable components** that include both card background images and standard images handled by Astro’s `<Image>` pipeline for on-the-fly optimization of assets for top performance scores.

**Plausible Analytics**—no cookies, no GDPR headaches, and minimal overhead. I've set up automated traffic and campaign data reporting to my inbox weekly.

These tools and the latest technology came together to build a new Gravital Digital site that has perfect 100s in Google Lighthouse—Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

## 1. Gravital Digital turns to Astro 5

Astro prides itself on bridging SSR (server-side rendering) capabilities with a Jamstack approach—where static files can be quickly deployed on CDNs. In Astro 5.x, you get:

- **Improved Partial Hydration**—send minimal JavaScript to the browser, so pages remain lightweight.
- **Better Developer Experience**—fewer configuration hurdles, modern CLI, and integration with UI libraries.
- **Jamstack Ease**—still ideal for building content-focused sites that deploy anywhere, from Netlify to Vercel, with minimal friction.

All this keeps your site zippy, especially important for a marketing page or online brand presence.

## 2. A Huge Tailwind CSS 4 Update

Since Astro 5 now includes a Tailwind integration by default, you don’t need extra steps for installation.

Tailwind 4.x brings:

- **Enhanced Color Palette**—fresh gradient utilities and color stops used in the card backgrounds.
- **Faster Compile Times**—less waiting, faster building.
- **Utility Class Improvements**—like improved container queries and better layout classes.

Together, Astro’s partial hydration plus Tailwind’s minimal overhead let us produce polished, modern layouts without bloat.

## 3. AI-generated video headline “Light. Speed.”

For the headline graphic, I created a dynamic text effect for my “Light. Speed.” brand tagline. After using several standard image-to-video AI generators, I found that the best results for animated text came from OpenAIs Sora. The raw output was a hefty MP4 though as you have limited controls for size. So, I used HandBrake to reduce bitrate, resulting in a file of 578KB. I could probably go smaller, but I didn't want to stomp the quality into the ground.

Placed in the hero area via Astro:
```html
<video
src=”/videos/light-speed.mp4”
autoplay
loop
muted
playsinline
preload=“auto”
poster=”/videos/light-speed-poster.jpeg”>
</video>
```
It’s compact, visually engaging, and crucial for that 100 in Lighthouse Performance. Note that this was further optimized later with multiple size videos. I did try to generate smaller .webm videos, but they ended up the same size as the MP4 variety, so I just eliminated them. MP4 (H.264) alone is sufficient for the vast majority of modern browsers and devices.

## 4. Saving time with Tailwind UI templates and Optimizing Media

TailwindUI has a set of HTML, React, and Vue pre-built components and snippets that are battle-tested for responsive behavior across a large number of devices. This is the main reason for the project being kept under 100 hours—it saves countless hours of testing and tweaking code across numerous devices.

After copying UI template code into our components, I then heavily customized them for content and some styling to keep to corporate styles, colors, and fonts. Tailwindcss updated their UI library recently with the launch of version 4, and I particularly love the new bento boxes. So I used them! As an example—for the Reliability, Speed, and Flexibility boxes—I chose to show a short looped MP4 video with a .webp image fallback for the poster image:
```html
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import tvBkgndTall from '../assets/tv-bkgnd-tall-1280.webp';
---

<div class="relative overflow-hidden">
  <Image
    src={tvBkgndTall}
    alt="AI background image"
    class="absolute inset-0 object-cover w-full h-full"
    loading="eager"
  />
  <video
    src="/videos/reliability.mp4"
    class="absolute top-[20%] left-[12%] w-[80%] h-[25%]"
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    playsinline
    preload="auto"
    poster="/videos/reliability-poster.jpeg"
  />
</div>
```
Note that we’re using Astro’s `<Image>` for the background graphics and give them the loading="eager" config so that this first component on the website will load quickly. Astro optimizes .webp automatically, producing a small, efficient file with no user intervention.

## 5. Integrating Fontsource Custom Fonts

Another new addition to this landing page is Fontsource, which simplifies installing and loading fonts directly from npm. Here’s a quick example of how I configured the project to use the Overpass Black (900) weight:

**a. Install the Fontsource Package**

`npm install @fontsource/overpass`

This gives us all weights for Overpass, but we only need the 900 weight for our bold titles.

**b. Import the Desired Weight**

In our global CSS file, we added:
```html
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@fontsource/overpass/900.css";

@theme {
  --font-overpass: 'Overpass', 'sans-serif';
}
```
This single import includes the “Overpass 900” font file. If you want multiple weights (400, 700, etc.), just import each (@fontsource/overpass/400.css, etc.).

**c. Import in Layout for Reliability (Optional?)**

In my case, the bundler couldn’t properly resolve the font files, so I was required to import the same Fontsource line inside my main Layout.astro file to get it to work properly. Depending on your setup, you might only need it once in global.css. But if that fails, also importing it in the layout ensures the @font-face rules are definitely included site-wide:
```
---
import '@fontsource/overpass/900.css';
---
<html> … </html>
```
**d. Use the Custom Font**

In our Tailwind config, we mapped an alias to that variable:
```html
// tailwind.config.js
theme: {
  fontFamily: {
    overpass: 'var(--font-overpass)',
  },
  // ...
}
```
Now any element with class="font-overpass" or a custom utility referencing font-overpass picks up the Overpass Black weight.

Note: We don’t necessarily need Fontsource integrated into Tailwind. Just importing the .css in global.css (and optionally in the layout) is enough for Overpass to load at build time. Tailwind then references the font name or a CSS variable the same as any locally hosted font.

This straightforward approach ensures Overpass 900 is loaded and recognized on the final page—without manually creating @font-face rules or copying font files. We just pick the weight we want (900.css), import it, and let Fontsource handle the rest!

## 6. Plausible Analytics for a Cookie-Free Experience

For analytics, I embedded Plausible in my Layout.astro. It’s cookie-free and ultra-lightweight, perfect for a privacy-focused Jamstack site:
```html
<!-- Plausible script -->
<script
  defer
  data-domain="gravitaldigital.com"
  src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"
></script>
```
No tracking cookies, no GDPR issues—and negligible performance impact. I then configured Plausible to provide traffic and campaign reports directly to my inbox every Monday.

<Image src={require('./07-plausible-layout.png')} alt="Plausible script integrated in the site layout" />

I then optimized all assets and deployed the project from GitHub to Netlify. From this point on, each commit triggers an automatic rebuild.

Running a Google Lighthouse report for desktop on the final site revealed:

-	Performance: 100
-	Accessibility: 100
-	Best Practices: 100
-	SEO: 100

Google Lighthouse showing perfect 100s across the board as you can see! ✨
