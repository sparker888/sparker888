Welcome to the fifth installment of my **Light. Speed. Series!** In the [previous article](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-4), we explored Astro—a framework known for simplicity, performance, and a Jamstack-friendly design. Now in **Astro 5.x**, development is even more streamlined, with updated features that make building high-performance sites easier than ever.

This new Gravital Digital landing page harnesses:

- **Astro’s 5.x version**—with partial hydration and server-side rendering improvements, perfect for a Jamstack workflow.  
- **Tailwind CSS 4.x**—bundled with Astro 5.x by default, featuring updated utilities and color palettes for lightning-fast styling.  
- **Optimized AI videos** (originally made with **Kling AI 1.6**), compressed via HandBrake to keep page load times minuscule.  
- **Multiple call-to-action components** that display background videos and images handled by Astro’s `<Image>` pipeline for on-the-fly optimization.  
- **Plausible Analytics**—no cookies, no GDPR headaches, just minimal overhead.

These elements come together for **perfect 100s in Google Lighthouse**—Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

## High-Level Overview of Astro 5.x

Astro prides itself on bridging SSR (server-side rendering) capabilities with a Jamstack approach—where static files can be quickly deployed on CDNs. In **Astro 5.x**, you get:

- **Improved Partial Hydration**—send minimal JavaScript to the browser, so pages remain lightweight.  
- **Better Developer Experience**—fewer configuration hurdles, modern CLI, and integration with UI libraries.  
- **Jamstack Ease**—still ideal for building content-focused sites that deploy anywhere, from Netlify to Vercel, with minimal friction.

All this keeps your site zippy, especially important for a marketing page or online brand presence.

## Tailwind CSS 4.x Updates

Since Astro 5.x now includes a Tailwind integration by default, you don’t need extra steps for installation. Tailwind 4.x brings:

- **Enhanced Color Palette**—fresh gradient utilities and color stops.  
- **Faster Compile Times**—less waiting, more building.  
- **Utility Class Improvements**—like improved container queries and better layout classes.  

Together, Astro’s partial hydration plus Tailwind’s minimal overhead let you produce polished, modern layouts without bloat.

## AI-Driven Hero with “Light. Speed.” Animation

For the main hero, I created a dynamic text effect—**“Light. Speed.”**—using **Kling AI 1.6**. The raw output was a hefty MP4. I then used HandBrake to reduce bitrate, resulting in a file under ~1 MB. Placed in the hero via Astro:

```html
<video
  class="object-contain w-full max-w-[768px] sm:h-[150px] sm:max-w-[768px] xl:h-[400px]"
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  preload="auto"
  poster="/videos/light-speed-poster.jpeg"
>
  <source src="/videos/OPTIMIZED-768x150-light-speed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

Compact, visually engaging, and crucial for that 100 in Lighthouse Performance.

## Multiple Call-to-Action Components, Optimized Media

I used multiple .astro components for reliability, speed, and flexibility sections—each showing a short looped MP4 with a .webp fallback for the poster image. For instance:

```html

---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import tvBkgndTall from '../assets/tv-bkgnd-tall-1280.webp';
---

<div class="relative overflow-hidden">
  <Image
    src={tvBkgndTall}
    alt="AI background image"
    class="absolute inset-0 object-cover w-full h-full"
    loading="eager"
  />
  <video
    class="absolute top-[20%] left-[12%] w-[80%] h-[25%]"
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    playsinline
    preload="auto"
    poster="/videos/reliability-poster.jpeg"
  >
    <source src="/videos/OPTIMIZED-960x540-reliability.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>
```

Each video is compressed to a few hundred kilobytes, ensuring the page loads swiftly.

## Astro’s `<Image>` for Extra Graphics

One highlight is the security/data flow illustration. Instead of a giant PNG, I used a WebP and Astro’s ```<Image>```:

```html
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import jamstackSecurity from '../assets/jamstack-security.webp';
---

<Image
  src={jamstackSecurity}
  alt="Security illustration"
  class="h-[min(152px,40cqw)] object-cover"
  loading="eager"
  decoding="auto"
/>
```

Astro optimizes .webp automatically, producing a small, efficient file with no user intervention.

## Plausible Analytics for a Cookie-Free Experience

For analytics, I embedded Plausible in my Layout.astro. It’s cookie-free and ultra-lightweight, perfect for a privacy-focused Jamstack site:

```html
---
import "../styles/global.css";
import Header from "../components/Header.astro";
import Footer from "../components/Footer.astro";

const {
  title = "Gravital Digital",
  description = "Unlock the full potential of Jamstack with Gravital Digital"
} = Astro.props;
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- ... meta tags ... -->
    <!-- Plausible script here -->
    <script
      defer
      data-domain="gravital-2025.netlify.app"
      src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body class="bg-black text-white min-h-screen relative bg-[url('/asphalt-background-256x256.png')] bg-repeat">
    <Header />
    <main class="px-6 py-12 mx-auto max-w-8xl">
      <slot />
    </main>
    <Footer />
  </body>
</html>
```

No tracking cookies, no GDPR issues—and negligible performance impact.

## Final Deploy & 100/100 Scores

Deployed on Netlify, each commit triggers an automatic rebuild. The final site boasts:
	•	Performance: 100
	•	Accessibility: 100
	•	Best Practices: 100
	•	SEO: 100

All with AI-driven visuals, multiple CTA components, and no cookies.

## Summary

By pairing Astro 5.x with Tailwind CSS 4.x and carefully optimizing each video/image, I built a slick, fast Jamstack page. Even advanced animations remain sub-1 MB after compression, preserving performance and user delight.

Key Takeaways:
	•	Astro 5.x → partial hydration, SSR for Jamstack, easy deployment.
	•	Tailwind CSS 4.x → new gradient utilities, updated color palettes, minimal overhead.
	•	AI-based visuals → shrink them via HandBrake to maintain speed.
	•	Astro ```<Image>``` → automatic image optimization for near-instant loads.
	•	Plausible → cookie-free analytics, minimal overhead, full privacy compliance.
