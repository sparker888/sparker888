WRS  has 30 years of creating unique conferences synonymous with high quality, practical presentations and the very best in networking. We aim to extend this offering by integrating modern digital solutions provided by Cvent, an industry leader in event software and my company's expertise in digital technology.
In this new role at Wheel Rail Seminars, I will be at the forefront of integrating and managing advanced event technologies to enhance our services. Key responsibilities include:

- **Event Technology Management:** Developing, implementing, and maintaining event technology tools, while staying abreast of industry standards.
- **Website Development:** Building websites integrating software platforms, optimizing user experiences, and collaborating with the team and clients.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzing event data to inform strategies and improve performance metrics.
- **On-Site Technology:** Implementing and managing on-site technology, including mobile event apps.

This work is an extension of my role as President of Gravital Digital. My experience working in the digital realm will now focus on this niche as I learn more about event software and complete Cvent certifications. My inclusion into the team is aimed at ensuring every aspect of event technology is covered with professionalism and expertise.

Reflecting on our successful collaboration with ENSCO for the TTC first Annual Conference and Tour in Pueblo, Colorado earlier this month, it's evident that teamwork and technological expertise are key to elevating event experiences. In developing a new website for the company at [https://wheel-rail-seminars.com](https://wheel-rail-seminars.com) seminars, I was impressed with all the positive comments about the company's Wheel Rail Interaction (WRI) conference they have been hosting for 30 years.

> “For three decades, the WRI conference has brought our industry together in a truly unique and open environment to share perspectives and move forward in ways that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”

In my role as Founder and President of [Gravital Digital](https://gravitaldigital.com) going back to the launch in 2011, I have been committed to building high-performance websites that offer superior speed, security, and ease of management. My focus on providing clients with higher Google search rankings, social media promotion, valuable audience content and enhanced user experiences to brands will be instrumental in shaping my approach to delivering results for Wheel Rail Seminars' clients.
