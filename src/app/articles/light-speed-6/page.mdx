## Light. Speed.✨: Claude AI Development in Action (Part 1 of 2)

Welcome to the sixth installment of my **Light. Speed. Series!** 

In [previous articles](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-5), we've explored high-performance web development with Astro, a web framework for content-driven websites, used in combination with modern deployment libraries, service APIs and edge hosting strategies. 

Today, I'm sharing something extraordinary: how I built a sophisticated web application in just 30 days using Claude AI as my development partner.

### The Challenge: A Complete Light. Speed.✨ Application in 30 Days

What started as a simple online prompt editor in 2023 evolved into my dream project—**Midjourney Prompt Manager (MPM)**—a sophisticated SaaS platform for creating, managing, and sharing Midjourney AI image generation prompts. This wasn't just a feature addition; it was a complete online systems architecture requiring:

- **Database Schema** with 11 collections and complex relationships
- **UI/UX Design System** from prompt editor to project & team management to galleries
- **Rich User Features** from basic prompt management to advanced team collaboration
- **Payment Integration** with 5-tier Stripe subscription model and discount codes
- **Public Gallery System** with rating, filtering, and user profiles & galleries

And, of course, to make it as fast as possible, it had to use a lightweight framework. Again, I reached for some of the fastest and lightest tools for the job:

- **Astro** delivers the best of both worlds—lightning-fast static sites with interactive islands that hydrate only when needed (more than just for static content)
- **htmx** provides AJAX, CSS Transitions, and WebSockets—it completes HTML as a hypertext  (this library truly has super powers)
- **Alpine.js** a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in markup
- **Tailwind CSS** - I couldn't really go without mentioning another serious tool in the arsenal not in my graphic below: utility-first styling that makes design systems scale without the CSS bloat

## 1. The Claude AI Development Partnership

Working with Claude AI fundamentally changed my development approach. Instead of writing every line of code myself, I became a **technical architect** guiding an AI development partner through complex system development.

### Development Methodology
- **Strategic Planning**: I defined requirements and architecture
- **Implementation Partnership**: Claude generated code, I reviewed and refined  
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous feedback loops for optimization
- **Documentation**: Real-time documentation as we built

Claude truly excelled at the following:
- **Code Generation**: Components, API endpoints, database schemas
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex editor, prompt management and integration issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Consistent coding patterns across the codebase (using the correct patterns and libraries for the problem at hand)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for every implementation phase (including detailed debugging notes)

## 2. Editor Evolution: From Basic to Advanced Prompt Editor

The heart of MPM is its prompt editor. What started as a simple prompt builder from 2023 needed a complete overhaul to match modern UX expectations and handle the complexity of Midjourney Prompt Manager's intricate prompt, project and team management systems.

### Editor: Enhanced Midjourney Parameters
First, Claude helped me formulate a look and feel for the application. We developed what I call "Glass Morphism"—a design language with a sophisticated color scheme much improved from the original editor styling. It's easy on the eyes (dark theme) and has an interesting animated background with many semi-transparent containers as can be seen here in the Midjourney Parameters area:

<Image src={require('./parameters-area.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

In addition to the theme, improvements to the UX were made such as adding a graphic that changes to represent the outline of the aspect ratio of the image (square here).

### Editor: Custom Accordion System with Style Badges
Claude helped transform standard HTML checkboxes and radio buttons into an elegant accordion-based interface. The initial editor didn't hide the style areas, and it was a UX issue as users had a lot of scrolling to do. Here, you can see that same glass morphism design combined with the full range color palette that matches the colors of the sidebar icons that enable users to quickly go to the section that they need:

<Image src={require('./cyberpunk-accordions.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

<Image src={require('./03-styles-area.png')} alt="Style selection area showing badges and organized categories" />

```jsx
{/* Before: Basic checkboxes */}
<input type="checkbox" id="cyberpunk" name="theme" value="cyberpunk" />
<label for="cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</label>

{/* After: Custom accordion with style badges */}
<div class="accordion-section" data-category="theme">
  <button class="accordion-trigger glass-morphism" 
          onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
    <span class="category-name">Theme Styles</span>
    <div class="style-badges">
      {selectedThemes.map(theme => (
        <span class="style-badge">{theme}</span>
      ))}
    </div>
    <svg class="accordion-icon">...</svg>
  </button>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    {/* Interactive style grid */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Advanced Style System Integration
Claude helped implement a sophisticated style management system that transforms the basic prompt editor into a powerful creative tool through the use of these styles, but more importantly, programming the logic for the data the user selects into a full string that can be easily copied into Midjourney with base prompt, Midjourney Parameters, and MPM styles combined into a natural-language prompt.

I've come up with a name for this, and that's the Key Prompt as seen here:

<Image src={require('./key-prompt-display.webp')} alt="Style selection area showing badges and organized categories" />

Here's the resulting image created in Midjourney using the Key Prompt from MPM:

<Image src={require('./elven-oracle.png')} alt="Style selection area showing badges and organized categories" />

### Editor: Built-in Team and Project Management Tools
Claude helped integrate a Prompt Management panel at the top of the new in-app editor, enabling team selection, dynamic project selection and on-the-fly project creation in a sleek glass morphism interface (with a pulsing background effect to bring it to life):

<Image src={require('./prompt-control-panel.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

The enhanced system features:
- **Glass morphism design** with backdrop blur and transparency effects
- **Visual style badges** showing selected options at the top of each accordion
- **Smooth animations** powered by Alpine.js for expand/collapse interactions
- **Intuitive organization** with 17 style categories and 1,300+ style options

<Image src={require('./03-editor-upgrade.png')} alt="Modern prompt editor with custom accordions and glass morphism design" />

The style system includes:
- **Dynamic badge updates** as users make selections
- **Category persistence** maintaining state across page refreshes  
- **Smart prompt generation** that intelligently combines all selections
- **Mobile-responsive design** adapting perfectly to any screen size

## 3. Astro View Transitions: Seamless Gallery Navigation

One of Astro's most powerful features is View Transitions, which create smooth, app-like navigation without full page reloads. Claude helped implement these transitions specifically for the gallery system, creating an exceptionally polished user experience.

<Image src={require('./04-gallery-new.webp')} alt="Gallery view showing grid of AI-generated prompt images" />

### Midjourney Prompt Detail Pages
When users click from the gallery to a prompt detail page, the transition focuses on the image, creating a zoom-like effect that maintains visual continuity:

<Image src={require('./page-transitions.webp')} alt="Prompt detail page showing large image with smooth transition animation" />

### Gallery-to-Detail Transition Implementation
```jsx
{/* Gallery card with transition names */}
<a href={`/public/prompts/${prompt.id}`} 
   transition:name={`prompt-${prompt.id}`}
   class="gallery-card">
  <img transition:name={`image-${prompt.id}`} 
       src={getOptimizedImageUrl(prompt.thumbnail)}
       alt={prompt.title}
       class="gallery-image" />
  <div transition:name={`details-${prompt.id}`} 
       class="prompt-info">
    <h3>{prompt.title}</h3>
    <p>{prompt.user.name}</p>
  </div>
</a>
```

## 4. Development Time: 4 Months Compressed into 30 Days

What would normally be a 4-month project was compressed into 30 days due to several key factors. Claude AI was by far the biggest contributor, primarily due to the AI's ability to add troubleshooting code in place and iterate through different solutions much faster than a human developer could. This was multiplied by following a proven tool stack that minimized architectural complexity.

Finally, there was the human element. I had been planning this project for months and prepared general architecture notes, example code, had a version 1.0 editor built, and pre-produced images and marketing content in advance. I worked every day of those 30 days, with several sessions burning the midnight oil.

<Image src={require('./03-development-phases.webp')} alt="Visual timeline showing 12 development phases over 30 days" />

The 30-day development cycle was organized into 12 distinct phases, each documented and completed with Claude's assistance:

### Phase 1-3: Foundation (Days 1-7)
**Database Schema & Authentication**
- Created the entire project database schema

### Hire AI-Savvy Developers!

Claude helped design this complex project, but translating requirements into architecture and UX requires skilled professionals. However, Claude Opus 4 excelled at generating TypeScript types, defining PocketBase collection rules, and creating data access patterns—saving me dozens of hours throughout development.

### Budget Impact: 2-4x Productivity Gains
Claude Opus 4 has become essential in my toolkit. I estimate **2x output** on this project compared to hand-coding (up to 4x in some areas). That's substantial productivity gain that translates to competitive client pricing.

### The Reality Check—I'll Be Real
While I was amazed daily by Claude's capabilities, there were unnecessary hours spent on poorly implemented code. Sometimes it would create duplicate systems or modify components I didn't request.

I felt like a babysitter watching a brilliant but impulsive child. It would randomly switch contexts and troubleshoot on the wrong branch (whoops!).

**But I'm still immensely impressed.** Having worked with AI since 2023, Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are **Next Level**.

The game-changer? Comprehensive project documentation specifically for the LLM. This is literally my business (I built a prompt builder!), so I know firsthand how critical good inputs are. Now that Opus 4 can work in terminal and Sonnet 4 can review entire repositories, the workflow is streamlined.

**Bottom line:** AI needs guidance, but skilled developers leveraging AI will become extraordinarily productive. We're all learning, but the future is incredibly bright.
