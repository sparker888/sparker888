## Light. Speed.✨: Claude AI Development in Action (Part 1 of 2)

Welcome to the sixth installment of my **Light. Speed. Series!** 

In [previous articles](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-5), we've explored high-performance web development with Astro, a web framework for content-driven websites, used in combination with modern deployment libraries, service APIs and edge hosting strategies. 

Today, I'm sharing something extraordinary: how I built a sophisticated web application in just 30 days using Claude AI as my development partner.

### The Challenge: A Complete Light. Speed.✨ Application in 30 Days

What started as a simple online prompt editor in 2023 evolved into my dream project—**Midjourney Prompt Manager (MPM)**—a sophisticated SaaS platform for creating, managing, and sharing Midjourney AI image generation prompts. This wasn't just a feature addition; it was a complete online systems architecture requiring:

- **Database Schema** with 11 collections and complex relationships
- **UI/UX Design System** from prompt editor to project & team management to galleries
- **Rich User Features** from basic prompt management to advanced team collaboration
- **Payment Integration** with 5-tier Stripe subscription model and discount codes
- **Public Gallery System** with rating, filtering, and user profiles & galleries

And, of course, to make it as fast as possible, it had to use a lightweight framework. Again, I reached for some of the fastest and lightest tools for the job:

- **Astro** delivers the best of both worlds—lightning-fast static sites with interactive islands that hydrate only when needed (more than just for static content)
- **htmx** provides AJAX, CSS Transitions, and WebSockets—it completes HTML as a hypertext  (this library truly has super powers)
- **Alpine.js** a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in markup
- **Tailwind CSS** - I couldn't really go without mentioning another serious tool in the arsenal not in my graphic below: utility-first styling that makes design systems scale without the CSS bloat

## 1. The Claude AI Development Partnership

Working with Claude AI fundamentally changed my development approach. Instead of writing every line of code myself, I became a **technical architect** guiding an AI development partner through complex system development.

### Development Methodology
- **Strategic Planning**: I defined requirements and architecture
- **Implementation Partnership**: Claude generated code, I reviewed and refined  
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous feedback loops for optimization
- **Documentation**: Real-time documentation as we built

Claude truly excelled at the following:
- **Code Generation**: Components, API endpoints, database schemas
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex editor, prompt management and integration issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Consistent coding patterns across the codebase (using the correct patterns and libraries for the problem at hand)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for every implementation phase (including detailed debugging notes)

## 2. Editor Evolution: From Basic to Advanced Prompt Editor

The heart of MPM is its prompt editor. What started as a simple prompt builder from 2023 needed a complete overhaul to match modern UX expectations and handle the complexity of Midjourney Prompt Manager's intricate prompt, project and team management systems.

### Editor: Enhanced Midjourney Parameters
First, Claude helped me formulate a look and feel for the application. We developed what I call "Glass Morphism"—a design language with a sophisticated color scheme much improved from the original editor styling. It's easy on the eyes (dark theme) and has an interesting animated background with many semi-transparent containers as can be seen here in the Midjourney Parameters area:

<Image src={require('./parameters-area.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

In addition to the theme, improvements to the UX were made such as adding a graphic that changes to represent the outline of the aspect ratio of the image (square here).

### Editor: Custom Accordion System with Style Badges
Claude helped transform standard HTML checkboxes and radio buttons into an elegant accordion-based interface. The initial editor didn't hide the style areas, and it was a UX issue as users had a lot of scrolling to do. Here, you can see that same glass morphism design combined with the full range color palette that matches the colors of the sidebar icons that enable users to quickly go to the section that they need:

<Image src={require('./cyberpunk-accordions.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

<Image src={require('./03-styles-area.png')} alt="Style selection area showing badges and organized categories" />

```jsx
{/* Before: Basic checkboxes */}
<input type="checkbox" id="cyberpunk" name="theme" value="cyberpunk" />
<label for="cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</label>

{/* After: Custom accordion with style badges */}
<div class="accordion-section" data-category="theme">
  <button class="accordion-trigger glass-morphism" 
          onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
    <span class="category-name">Theme Styles</span>
    <div class="style-badges">
      {selectedThemes.map(theme => (
        <span class="style-badge">{theme}</span>
      ))}
    </div>
    <svg class="accordion-icon">...</svg>
  </button>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    {/* Interactive style grid */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Advanced Style System Integration
Claude helped implement a sophisticated style management system that transforms the basic prompt editor into a powerful creative tool through the use of these styles, but more importantly, programming the logic for the data the user selects into a full string that can be easily copied into Midjourney with base prompt, Midjourney Parameters, and MPM styles combined into a natural-language prompt.

I've come up with a name for this, and that's the Key Prompt as seen here:

<Image src={require('./key-prompt-display.webp')} alt="Style selection area showing badges and organized categories" />

### Editor: Built-in Team and Project Management Tools
Claude helped integrate a Prompt Management panel at the top of the new in-app editor, enabling team selection, dynamic project selection and on-the-fly project creation in a sleek glass morphism interface (with a pulsing background effect to bring it to life):

<Image src={require('./prompt-control-panel.webp')} alt="Screenshot of the Midjourney Parameters area with Glass Morphism Design" />

The enhanced system features:
- **Glass morphism design** with backdrop blur and transparency effects
- **Visual style badges** showing selected options at the top of each accordion
- **Smooth animations** powered by Alpine.js for expand/collapse interactions
- **Intuitive organization** with 17 style categories and 1,300+ style options

<Image src={require('./03-editor-upgrade.png')} alt="Modern prompt editor with custom accordions and glass morphism design" />

The style system includes:
- **Dynamic badge updates** as users make selections
- **Category persistence** maintaining state across page refreshes  
- **Smart prompt generation** that intelligently combines all selections
- **Mobile-responsive design** adapting perfectly to any screen size

## 3. Astro View Transitions: Seamless Gallery Navigation

One of Astro's most powerful features is View Transitions, which create smooth, app-like navigation without full page reloads. Claude helped implement these transitions specifically for the gallery system, creating an exceptionally polished user experience.

<Image src={require('./04-gallery-new.webp')} alt="Gallery view showing grid of AI-generated prompt images" />

### Midjourney Prompt Detail Pages
When users click from the gallery to a prompt detail page, the transition focuses on the image, creating a zoom-like effect that maintains visual continuity:

<Image src={require('./page-transitions.webp')} alt="Prompt detail page showing large image with smooth transition animation" />

### Gallery-to-Detail Transition Implementation
```jsx
{/* Gallery card with transition names */}
<a href={`/public/prompts/${prompt.id}`} 
   transition:name={`prompt-${prompt.id}`}
   class="gallery-card">
  <img transition:name={`image-${prompt.id}`} 
       src={getOptimizedImageUrl(prompt.thumbnail)}
       alt={prompt.title}
       class="gallery-image" />
  <div transition:name={`details-${prompt.id}`} 
       class="prompt-info">
    <h3>{prompt.title}</h3>
    <p>{prompt.user.name}</p>
  </div>
</a>
```

## 4. Development Time: 4 Months Compressed into 30 Days

What would normally be a 4-month project was compressed into 30 days due to several key factors. Claude AI was by far the biggest contributor, primarily due to the AI's ability to add troubleshooting code in place and iterate through different solutions much faster than a human developer could. This was multiplied by following a proven tool stack that minimized architectural complexity.

Finally, there was the human element. I had been planning this project for months and prepared general architecture notes, example code, had a version 1.0 editor built, and pre-produced images and marketing content in advance. I worked every day of those 30 days, with several sessions burning the midnight oil.

<Image src={require('./03-development-phases.webp')} alt="Visual timeline showing 12 development phases over 30 days" />

The 30-day development cycle was organized into 12 distinct phases, each documented and completed with Claude's assistance:

### Phase 1-3: Foundation (Days 1-7)

### Hire AI-Savvy Developers!

Claude helped design this complex project, but understanding requirements and translating them into architecture, logic, and UX requires a skilled professional. However, many tasks are perfect for AI LLMs—Claude Opus 4 is specifically trained for these challenges. In my case, Claude excelled at generating TypeScript types, defining PocketBase collection rules, and creating data access patterns. It saved me dozens of hours on coding and debugging throughout the Midjourney Prompt Manager development.

### What Claude Means for Your Budget
Working with Claude, I'm already seeing significant benefits from using AI for complex tasks. While it's not always faster than a human familiar with the codebase for basic content updates, Claude Opus 4 has become a major tool in my arsenal. I reach for it increasingly often as AI improves at coding—there's simply no reason not to. I estimate my output was 2x on this project compared to coding and debugging by hand (I can argue up to a 4x improvement in some areas though). That's substantial productivity gain that translates to competitive pricing for clients.

### What Claude Isn't (Yet)—I'll Be Real
While I was amazed daily by Claude's capabilities, there were many unnecessary hours spent on code that Claude attempted to implement poorly. Sometimes it would create two systems handling the same logic. Occasionally it would modify component parts I didn't request, forcing me to backtrack.

More often than I care to admit, I felt like a babysitter watching a brilliant but impulsive child who couldn't stay focused. There were numerous times it would randomly switch contexts and start troubleshooting on the wrong branch (whoops!).

I'm not exaggerating.

**I'm still immensely impressed with what Anthropic has done with Claude Opus 4.** Having worked closely with AI (primarily ChatGPT Pro) since 2023, Opus 4 (and Sonnet 4, quite honestly) are next level.

Yes. I said it. **Next Level**.

There are important caveats to working with Opus 4. I've learned that well-constructed prompts are only part of the story. The real game-changer is comprehensive project documentation—not just for you and other developers, but specifically for the LLM. This is literally my business - I built a prompt builder(!), so I know firsthand how critical good inputs are.

**The reality check:** AI is here to stay, but it needs a lot of guidance to work well. You still need a skilled web developer who knows the ropes. We're all in a massive learning phase right now. I had the luxury of developing in isolation, which was another huge contributing factor to compressing that 4-month timeline.

**The future is bright:** Web developers will become increasingly productive as they integrate AI into their workflows and let it control more of those workflows.
