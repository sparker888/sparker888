In an era of rapid advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), the boundaries between creativity and technology have become more fluid than ever. One notable aspect of this convergence is the generation of AI-driven images, a phenomenon that holds great promise while raising concerns about originality and intellectual property (IP) rights. As both an advocate for AI-generated art and a supporter of artists' recognition, Iâ€™ve decided to build an app named Midjourney Prompt Manager, a powerful tool to streamline the Midjourney experience, protect artists' work, and provide them with the credit they deserve.

## The Current Issues of AI-generated Art

AI-generated art has opened doors to new realms of artistic expression, enabling creators to explore uncharted territories and collaborate with algorithms in unprecedented ways. However, this innovation comes with its share of challenges. The widespread use of AI has given rise to deepfakes, unauthorized reproductions, and the potential misuse of artists' original styles. It's crucial to address these concerns and ensure artists' creativity is protected in the digital landscape.

## A possible solution: Midjourney Prompt Manager

I am pleased to introduce the Midjourney Prompt Manager, an application designed with the needs of both AI enthusiasts and artists in mind. At its core, the Midjourney Prompt Manager seeks to enhance the Midjourney experience, making it easier for users to navigate, create, and manage prompts within the platform. I've created a mini manifesto of five points to address both issues with creating AI art in a program named Discord, which is cumbersome to use when trying to manage your work and to help address the artists' IP issue:

1. **Streamlined Midjourney Experience:** The Midjourney Prompt Manager acknowledges the complexities users often face when managing prompts and images within Discord. With my application, users can enjoy pulling prompts from right within Discord, and saving them to their account page to help manage the process in a far more organized way.

2. **Effortless Prompt Creation:** Crafting accurate prompts is essential for generating high-quality AI art. The tool simplifies this process, offering users intuitive tools that help create prompts by presenting the myriad of properties from Midjourney you can include in prompts. This helps with producing results closer to the envisioned images and helps to reduce trial and error associated with working with a large range of modifiers that Midjourney provides.

3. **Structured Prompt Organization:** The Midjourney Prompt Manager empowers users to organize their their workflow by organizing their prompts by project, category, and tags. This organizational structure ensures that users can easily access and reuse their prompts for future projects. It also helps users to iterate the process of refining their prompts to achieve specific goals with their images.

4. **Effective Image Management:** Alongside prompts, users often accumulate a variety of generated images. The tool simplifies the task of managing and organizing these images and the prompts associated with each.

5. **Protecting Artists' Intellectual Property:** Recognizing the importance of safeguarding artists' work, the Midjourney Prompt Manager introduces an innovative feature that embeds watermarks and/or QR codes in AI-generated images that feature the style of a particular artist. This ensures that artists receive proper recognition for their creations and helps safeguard their IP.

## Supporting Artists' Recognition and Protection

As an advocate for both AI-generated art and artists' rights, I am committed to empowering creators and protecting their intellectual property. The inclusion of watermarking and QR codes in AI-generated images marks a significant step toward achieving this goal. These embedded elements not only offer artists due credit but also provide a direct link to the artists' profiles, enabling audiences to learn more about the creative minds behind the artwork. It may not be a perfect solution, but it's a start. I invite feedback from artists on this concept and I'm open to better realistic solutions.
