In today's fast-evolving digital landscape, staying ahead requires innovative strategies. Here are the top ten tactics I recommend to clients for building their brands, growing their audiences, and increasing revenue in 2024.

## 1. Build Your Site for Speed:

A one-second delay in loading time can lead to a 16% decrease in customer satisfaction, an 11% drop in page views, and a 7% loss in conversions. Optimize your website to load in two seconds or less with a Jamstack front end.

## 2. Use AI to Power Your Content Creation:

AI tools are essential for SEO, assisting with keyword targeting, content generation, imagery, and video editing. They enhance content quality for improved engagement, shares, and backlinks, in addition to optimizing for search engines.

## 3. Create Social Posts for Conversation:

Write more posts that foster dialogue and feedback, using bite-sized video content and interactive elements like polls and quizzes. This approach, combined with the integration of social commerce features, allows for more direct and engaging interactions with your audience

## 4. Start or Join a Discord Server:

While large social platforms maintain their importance, niche discussion platforms like Discord are gaining traction. They offer deeper engagement with audiences sharing specific interests. These platforms require a conversational approach for effective audience building.

## 5. Treat Direct SMS Communications Wisely:

SMS marketing remains a potent direct communication tool. Balance message frequency and relevance, personalize based on customer data, and always provide value. Ensure compliance with privacy laws and secure explicit opt-in consent.

## 6. Optimize Your Site for Accessibility:

Implement color contrast for low vision accessibility, enable keyboard navigation, provide alternative text for images, and test with assistive technologies. Adhere to the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) for inclusive web design.

## 7. Integrate Video into Your Content:

Leverage the power of video content, which continues to be highly engaging. Utilize short-form videos on TikTok and Instagram Reels for quick engagement, and long-form content on YouTube for detailed information. Live streaming can also offer real-time interaction.

## 8. Enhance User Experience for E-commerce:

Prioritize a seamless e-commerce experience with an intuitive interface, quick load times, and easy checkout. Personalize recommendations, ensure mobile-friendliness, and consider AR/VR technologies for an immersive shopping experience. Regular feedback collection and analysis are crucial for ongoing improvements.

## 9. Provide Clear CTAs in Your Email Campaigns:

Emails are a staple in digital marketing. Ensure your CTAs are distinct and compelling. Segment your email lists for targeted content, and continuously test different designs and formats to optimize open and click-through rates.

## 10. Let Data Guide Your Campaign Tactics:

Double-check your analytics are correctly in place and use 2023 as a baseline. Make sure all your campaigns are properly tracked for the year. Embrace data-driven strategies to understand audience behaviors and preferences. If possible, conduct A/B testing to refine tactics. Stay flexible to adapt based on insights.

### Wishing you a prosperous new year filled with growth and success!
