## New Updates for Midjourney Prompt Manager alpha!

I've made some helpful updates to Midjourney Prompt Manager alpha. They are based on tester feedback and I hope they will improve your experience and streamline your workflow in the alpha version until I get the beta up later this month.

### Changes to Key Prompt output

#### 1. Removal of “/imagine” in Prompts
With Midjourney’s alpha web-based version now live, I've removed the “/imagine” command from the prompts used in Discord. This change aligns with the new web-based interface, simplifying the process and making it more intuitive.

#### 2. Made --style raw the default
The '--style raw' parameter is now the default option, as most users are utilizing MPM to create realistic photographs. In the beta version, with an account, you will be able to customize this setting.

### Enhanced Usability

#### 3. Added More Keywords and Phrases
I have added new keywords to help you create more diverse and dynamic prompts. This includes themes, emotions, natural lighting, and more.

#### 4. Alphabetized Keywords
I have reorganized and alphabetized the keywords to make it easier for you to find what you're looking for in each section. This small change should significantly improve your navigation and prompt creation efficiency.

### New Keywords Added

- **Cyberpunk**: Popular and easily recognizable aesthetic.
- **Steampunk**: Growing in popularity, distinct visual style.

- **Moonlight/Starlight**: Creates a romantic or mysterious setting.

#### Time of Day

### Improved Usability
