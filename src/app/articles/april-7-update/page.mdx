## April Update: Research-Driven Prompt Strategy & Midjourney v7 Improvements  
_Updated: April 7, 2025_

I'm thrilled to announce our latest **Midjourney Prompt Manager** update! Since Midjourney v7 launched late last week, I've conducted in-depth **research** and **A/B testing** with ChatGPt o1 pro to see how different prompt structures (short keyword lists vs. flowing descriptive sentences) impact results in **Midjourney v7**. Below, I’ll share my findings, outline my **new strategy** for Midjourney v7 prompt generation, and show you examples from three different tests.

## **1. Research & Testing**

I embarked on a series of experiments to compare prompts:
- **Original, unstructured keyword lists** – quick lists of styles, angles, and colors.
- **New descriptive approach** – weaving user inputs into a short, coherent sentence or two.

I tested each approach against **Midjourney v7** (and sometimes v6.1) using various parameters like `--ar`, `--stylize`, `--c`, and `--q`. Our primary goals were **realism**, **visual consistency**, and **clarity of style**.

### Key Observations

1. **Flowing Descriptions** sometimes produce **more diverse** color palettes and smoother transitions.
2. **Keyword-Style Prompts** can yield **bold, uniform** styling or color emphasis, especially at higher `--stylize` or `--c`.
3. **No Single Format** is *always* best. Each approach might be more suitable depending on your creative vision. 

## **2. The New Strategy**

After poring over test images and user feedback, I’ve **updated the prompt creation logic** inside Midjourney Prompt Manager:

1. **Start with the user’s base prompt** (the most important piece).
2. **Merge all style selections** (theme, mood, camera, colors, lighting) into **one descriptive phrase**.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     in a futuristic, cinematic style, viewed from a top-down angle, shot on IMAX...
     ```
3. **Append** any special **Midjourney parameters** at the end (e.g., `--v 7 --ar 1:1`), ensuring no duplicates.
4. **Avoid over-labeling** (like “Theme: …” or “Mood: …”) which can sometimes dilute emphasis.

This approach still clarifies user choices but **presents** them to Midjourney in a succinct, natural way.

## **3. Example Prompt**

Here’s a condensed sample I used in one test:

A hidden valley inhabited by ethereal creatures. The environment has a whimsical, otherworldly ambiance, with vibrant alien flora. Soft morning light at dawn casts subtle glimmers, while a surreal dreamlike aura envelops the entire scene. in a magical realism, ethereal style, viewed from a low angle shot, shot on canon eos 5d mark iv, dawn lighting, at sunrise, with a fantasy vibe, accented by holographic glow, god rays, featuring vibrant colors, polychromatic, emerald green, gold, mint, teal, pastel colors, with flowing fabric, translucent, chromatic aberration, bioluminescence, phosphorescence effects –v 7 –ar 16:9 –c 30 –s 500

**In short**, it’s the same attributes as a bullet list, but rephrased into a coherent sentence.

Here's a more **human** readable output that's geared to assist in parameter selections and category selections as you may have seen:

<h3>Start with a base prompt</h3>
<p>
  A futuristic cityscape filled with flying cars. The environment has a cinematic
  and mysterious flair, showcasing bold street art. Overcast skies during twilight
  lend a dramatic atmosphere, while neon glows and reflections emphasize the
  advanced cyberpunk aesthetic.

## **4. Test Results**

To illustrate, I’ll show three sets of images where I applied **original** vs. **new** strategies. Each set contains two images: **(a)** and **(b)**. I recommend embedding them at these points in the article, so readers can see each comparison side by side.

### **Test 1**

<Image
  src="/images/test-1b.webp"
  alt="Test 1b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
Image: 1b (new)

### Results:

**1a (original):**  
- Emphasizes a direct color palette—pinks and oranges look bright and uniform.  
- The environment is mostly one or two major hues. The highlight transitions are strong but less varied overall.

**1b (new):**  
- Uses a descriptive phrase, creating smoother gradations among hues.  
- The sky and reflections blend more softly, resulting in a slightly more atmospheric or “dreamy” feel.

### **Test 2**

Image: 2a (original)
<Image
  src="/images/test-2b.webp"
  alt="Test 2b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
Image: 2b (new)

### Results:

**2a (original):**  
- Feels direct and bold, focusing on pink/purple tones, offering a crisp look.  
- Fewer subtle transitions, so the environment maintains a simpler overall palette.

**2b (new):**  
- Conveys a more layered effect, with subtle bokeh in the foreground or background.  
- Lighting shifts can be more complex, adding depth and gentle color variation.

### **Test 3**

<Image

Image: 3a (original)
<Image
  src="/images/test-3b.webp"
  alt="Test 3b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
Image: 3b (new)

### Results:

**3a (original):**  
- Showcases a strong, warm palette—intense sunset tones for the crystals or sky.  
- Color transitions tend to be more uniform, emphasizing bright oranges and pinkish reflections.

**3b (new):**  
- More multi-hued, revealing slight shifts among peach, mint, lavender, etc.  
- Often feels more “luminous,” with softer transitions in water, sky, and highlights.

### **Test 4**

For our fourth test, we focused on a **futuristic runway scene** featuring a model and a cyberpunk city backdrop. As usual, **(a)** is the **original keyword list** approach, while **(b)** is the **new descriptive** approach.

<Image
  src="/images/test-4a.webp"
  alt="Test 4a - Original Prompt Strategy"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
Image: 4a (original)
<Image
  src="/images/test-4b.webp"
  alt="Test 4b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
Image: 4b (new)

### Results:

**4a (original):**
	•	Emphasizes straightforward keywords (e.g., “Model, futuristic city rooftop, neon glow, cinematic lighting, edgy vibe”).
	•	The resulting image features a neon outfit and moody background, but color transitions may be more uniform. The subject is clearly a model in a sci-fi setting, with focus on bright neon accents.

**4b (new):**
	•	Uses full-sentence storytelling—“A model steps onto a neon-lit rooftop runway, wearing a sleek, futuristic outfit with holographic highlights, etc.”
	•	This often yields a more cinematic perspective, with additional background details or subtle transitions in lighting and color. Notice how you can see multiple figures in the background, plus a polished metallic effect on the outfit.

## **5. Conclusions & Next Steps**

- **Prompt Variation Matters**: The smallest tweak—whether rearranging words or removing extra labels—can shift Midjourney’s interpretation.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Sometimes mixing short, direct style keywords into a semi-descriptive phrase yields the strongest synergy.
- **Ongoing Refinement**: I plan to keep testing with upcoming Midjourney updates. Our user interface will likely evolve further to let you choose how verbose or minimal you want your final prompt phrasing.

### Looking Ahead
I remain committed to providing the best user experience for **Midjourney v7** (and beyond). Keep an eye out for:
- **Beta collaboration tools** (shared prompt boards).
- More advanced **negative prompt** handling.
- Continued expansions of themes, moods, and color sets.
