## April Update: Research-Driven Prompt Strategy & Midjourney v7 Improvements  
_Updated: April 7, 2025_

I'm thrilled to announce our latest **Midjourney Prompt Manager** update! Since Midjourney v7 launched late last week, I've conducted in-depth **research** and **A/B testing** with ChatGPt o1 pro to see how different prompt structures (short keyword lists vs. flowing descriptive sentences) impact results in **Midjourney v7**. Below, I’ll share my findings, outline my **new strategy** for Midjourney v7 prompt generation, and show you examples from three different tests.

## **1. Research & Testing**

We embarked on a series of experiments to compare prompts:
- **Original, unstructured keyword lists** – quick lists of styles, angles, and colors.
- **New descriptive approach** – weaving user inputs into a short, coherent sentence or two.

We tested each approach against **Midjourney v7** (and sometimes v6.1) using various parameters like `--ar`, `--stylize`, `--c`, and `--q`. Our primary goals were **realism**, **visual consistency**, and **clarity of style**.

### Key Observations

1. **Flowing Descriptions** sometimes produce **more diverse** color palettes and smoother transitions.
2. **Keyword-Style Prompts** can yield **bold, uniform** styling or color emphasis, especially at higher `--stylize` or `--c`.
3. **No Single Format** is *always* best. Each approach might be more suitable depending on your creative vision. 

## **2. The New Strategy**

After poring over test images and user feedback, I’ve **updated the prompt creation logic** inside Midjourney Prompt Manager:

1. **Start with the user’s base prompt** (the most important piece).
2. **Merge all style selections** (theme, mood, camera, colors, lighting) into **one descriptive phrase**.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     in a futuristic, cinematic style, viewed from a top-down angle, shot on IMAX...
     ```
3. **Append** any special **Midjourney parameters** at the end (e.g., `--v 7 --ar 1:1`), ensuring no duplicates.
4. **Avoid over-labeling** (like “Theme: …” or “Mood: …”) which can sometimes dilute emphasis.

This approach still clarifies user choices but **presents** them to Midjourney in a succinct, natural way.

## **3. Example Prompt**

Here’s a condensed sample we used in one test:

A hidden valley inhabited by ethereal creatures. The environment has a whimsical, otherworldly ambiance, with vibrant alien flora. Soft morning light at dawn casts subtle glimmers, while a surreal dreamlike aura envelops the entire scene. in a magical realism, ethereal style, viewed from a low angle shot, shot on canon eos 5d mark iv, dawn lighting, at sunrise, with a fantasy vibe, accented by holographic glow, god rays, featuring vibrant colors, polychromatic, emerald green, gold, mint, teal, pastel colors, with flowing fabric, translucent, chromatic aberration, bioluminescence, phosphorescence effects –v 7 –ar 16:9 –c 30 –s 500

**In short**, it’s the same attributes as a bullet list, but rephrased into a coherent sentence.

Here's a more **human** readable output that's geared to assist in parameter selections and category selections as you may have seen:

<h3>Start with a base prompt</h3>
<p>
  A futuristic cityscape filled with flying cars. The environment has a cinematic
  and mysterious flair, showcasing bold street art. Overcast skies during twilight
  lend a dramatic atmosphere, while neon glows and reflections emphasize the
  advanced cyberpunk aesthetic.

## **4. Test Results**

To illustrate, I’ll show three sets of images where we applied **original** vs. **new** strategies. Each set contains two images: **(a)** and **(b)**. We recommend embedding them at these points in the article, so readers can see each comparison side by side.

### **Test 1**

/>
<Image
  src="/images/test-1b.webp"
  alt="Test 1b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

	•	1a (original) shows strong color uniformity—pinks and oranges are very bold.
	•	1b (new) has subtler transitions among hues, giving the sky and reflections a softer blend.

### **Test 2**

<Image
  src="/images/test-2a.webp"
  alt="Test 2a - Original Prompt Strategy"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
<Image
  src="/images/test-2b.webp"
  alt="Test 2b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

	•	2a (original) feels direct and bright: the environment is crisp, with a simpler color scheme focusing on pink/purple.
	•	2b (new) conveys a more atmospheric, layered effect—notice the subtle bokeh and depth, plus additional color shifts in the flowers and lighting.

### **Test 3**

<Image
  src="/images/test-3a.webp"
  alt="Test 3a - Original Prompt Strategy"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
<Image
  src="/images/test-3b.webp"
  alt="Test 3b - New Descriptive Approach"
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>

	•	3a (original) showcases a strong, warm palette, with shimmering crystals bathed in intense sunset tones. The highlights lean more uniform, emphasizing bright oranges and pinkish reflections.
	•	3b (new) allows for a more multi-hued effect across each crystal, revealing subtle shifts from peach to mint and lavender. It feels slightly more “luminous,” with softer transitions in the sky and water.

Overall, the original prompt in 3a pushes a saturated, single‐dominant hue, while the descriptive style in 3b embraces a wider range of shimmering pastel variations. Which you prefer might depend on whether you want a focused, dramatic scene or a more ethereal, prismatic atmosphere.

## **5. Conclusions & Next Steps**

- **Prompt Variation Matters**: The smallest tweak—whether rearranging words or removing extra labels—can shift Midjourney’s interpretation.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Sometimes mixing short, direct style keywords into a semi-descriptive phrase yields the strongest synergy.
- **Ongoing Refinement**: We plan to keep testing with upcoming Midjourney updates. Our user interface will likely evolve further to let you choose how verbose or minimal you want your final prompt phrasing.

### Looking Ahead
We remain committed to providing the best user experience for **Midjourney v7** (and beyond). Keep an eye out for:
- **Beta collaboration tools** (shared prompt boards).
- More advanced **negative prompt** handling.
- Continued expansions of themes, moods, and color sets.
