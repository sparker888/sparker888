Welcome to the fourth installment of my **Light. Speed. Series!** In the [previous article](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-3), we explored Astro, a framework designed for simplicity, performance, and flexibility. Today, we’ll focus on **Astro’s development workflow**, from setting up your first project to deploying and managing changes with ease.

## Getting Started with Astro

Setting up Astro is incredibly straightforward. With its intuitive structure and built-in features, you can go from zero to a working site in minutes. Here’s how:

### Install Astro

Run this command in your terminal to initialize a new Astro project:

```
npm create astro@latest
```

Choose a template that fits your needs, such as a blog or portfolio, and navigate to your project folder:

```
cd your-project-name
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

To preview your project locally, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you’ll see your new Astro site live and ready for customization.

## Understanding Astro’s File Structure

Astro’s clean file structure keeps things simple:

- **`src/pages/`**: Create pages here. For example, `src/pages/about.astro` will render at `/about`.
- **`src/components/`**: Store reusable components like headers or footers.
- **`public/`**: Serve static assets, like images or fonts, from this directory.

Astro combines server-side logic and HTML within `.astro` files. The result? Clean, efficient code that’s easy to maintain.

## Pro Tip! Integrating Tailwind CSS

Want powerful, responsive styles? This is jumping ahead to another topic, but it's a good idea to add Tailwind CSS to your Astro project with one command:

```
npx astro add tailwind
```

You will thank me later (stay tuned for the article on Tailwind styling)!

Restart your server with:

```
npm run dev
```

Tailwind’s Preflight styles reset browser defaults, giving you a clean slate for styling. Use Tailwind classes in your `.astro` files to rapidly create modern designs.

## Deploying to Netlify

Astro’s deployment process with Netlify is seamless:

1. **Initialize Git**:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```
   git remote add origin `<your-repo-url>`
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Connect to Netlify**:  
   Log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), select New Site and then choose your GitHub repository from the selections.

4. **Set Build Settings**:  
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`

   <Image src={require('./8-netlify-deploy-settings.png')} alt="Review Netlify Build Settings" />

5. **Deploy**:  
   Click **Deploy Site**, and your site will be live!

Netlify provides a site dashboard for all projects where you can easily configure different settings for your project. I recommend using their branch deployment feature which supports branch-specific deployments, making it easy to manage staging environments.

## Development Workflow

Astro’s true power shines in its daily workflow. Here’s how I manage projects:

### Create a Development Branch

For new features or fixes, start a new branch:

```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Work Locally

Preview changes live with the development server (`npm run dev`). Test and refine before pushing your code.

### Push to a Development Branch

Once satisfied, push to the remote development branch:

```
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Netlify can automatically deploy this branch to a staging environment (e.g., `dev-your-site.netlify.app`). Share the staging site with clients for feedback.

### Merge to Production

After client approval, merge your branch into `main`:

```
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main
```

Netlify automatically updates your production site—no manual intervention required.

This workflow emphasizes simplicity: work locally, review on staging, and deploy to production—all while maintaining speed and quality.

## Summary

Astro and Netlify together create an unparalleled developer experience. Whether you’re just starting or managing daily iterations, their tools simplify every aspect of modern web development.
