These new themes have been integrated into our existing list, which has been alphabetized for easier navigation.

### 2. Personalization Feature

I'm thrilled to introduce a new personalization feature that allows you to tailor your Midjourney prompts to your unique style preferences. This feature is now available in the app, aligned with Midjourney Version 6.

#### How it works:
- You can now add the `--p` or `--personalize` parameter to your prompts.
- This parameter takes into account your choices when ranking image pairs on midjourney.com.
- By default, `--p` applies your own personalization, but you can also use other users' personalization by adding their shortcode: `--p shortcode`.

#### Using Personalization in Midjourney Prompt Manager:
- In the app, you'll find a new checkbox labeled "Add Personalization (--p)".
- Check this box to add the `--p` tag to your prompt.
- You also have the option to enter a specific personal shortcode in the provided field.

**Important Note:** To use this feature effectively, you need to have completed enough Rank Pairs on the Midjourney website. If you haven't done so, you'll see an error message prompting you to do more ranking.

### 3. Known Issue with Reference Images

I want to acknowledge a known issue that some users have reported. There's currently an error with the reference images popping up when you paste the `--sref` and `--sw` parameters into the Midjourney web browser version of the app. I'm aware of this problem and am actively working on a solution. I hope to have a fix implemented over the weekend.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as I work to resolve this issue. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me improve the Midjourney Prompt Manager experience.

Stay tuned for more updates, and happy prompting!
