- **Global CDN:** CloudFront delivery for sub-200ms image loading worldwide

```javascript
// Smart image optimization system
const getOptimizedImageUrl = (originalUrl, options = {}) => {
  const { width = 800, quality = 85, format = 'auto' } = options;
  
  // Base64 encode transformation parameters
  const transformations = btoa(JSON.stringify({
    resize: { width, fit: 'inside', withoutEnlargement: true },
    webp: { quality },
    jpeg: { quality }
  }));
  
  return `https://cdn.midjourneypromptmanager.com/${transformations}/${originalUrl}`;
}
```
