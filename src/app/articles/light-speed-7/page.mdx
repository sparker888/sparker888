## Light. Speed.✨: Advanced Features & Production Excellence

Welcome to part two of my journey building **Midjourney Prompt Manager (MPM)** with Claude AI! 

In [part one](https://sparker888.com/articles/light-speed-6), we covered the 30-day development sprint, the partnership with Claude AI, and the foundation of the application. Now let's dive deep into the advanced features, production deployment strategies, and the impressive performance metrics we achieved.

## 1. Advanced Features Built with Claude AI

### Smart Image Management System
Claude helped implement a sophisticated image system combining PocketBase and AWS S3:

```typescript
// Image optimization pipeline designed with Claude
export async function uploadPromptImage(
  file: File, 
  promptId: string, 
  isReference: boolean = false
): Promise<PromptImage> {
  // 1. Upload to PocketBase for quick access
  const record = await pb.collection('prompt_images').create({
    prompt: promptId,
    is_reference: isReference,
    // ... other fields
  }, { file });

  // 2. Background upload to S3 for optimization
  await uploadToS3({
    file,
    key: `prompts/${promptId}/${record.id}`,
    bucket: 'mpm-images',
    transforms: {
      thumbnail: '400x400',
      medium: '800x800', 
      large: '1200x1200'
    }
  });

  return record;
}
```

### Real-time Search with Fuse.js
Claude implemented advanced search functionality that indexes prompt content, style selections, and metadata:

```typescript
// Search system designed with Claude's assistance
const searchOptions = {
  includeScore: true,
  threshold: 0.3,
  keys: [
    { name: 'title', weight: 0.3 },
    { name: 'base_prompt', weight: 0.4 },
    { name: 'style_selections.theme', weight: 0.2 },
    { name: 'parameters.tags', weight: 0.1 }
  ]
};

const fuse = new Fuse(prompts, searchOptions);
const results = fuse.search(query);
```

## 2. Stripe Integration & Subscription System

Working with Claude, we implemented a sophisticated 5-tier subscription system:

### Subscription Tiers with Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Subscription system designed with Claude
const PLANS = {
  FREE: {
    name: 'Starter',
    price: 0,
    limits: { prompts: 25, storage: '1GB', projects: 3 }
  },
  BASIC: {
    name: 'Basic',
    price: 9,
    limits: { prompts: 100, storage: '5GB', projects: 10 }
  },
  PRO: {
    name: 'Pro', 
    price: 19,
    limits: { prompts: 500, storage: '25GB', projects: 50 }
  },
  TEAM: {
    name: 'Team',
    price: 39,
    limits: { prompts: 1000, storage: '100GB', projects: 100 }
  },
  ENTERPRISE: {
    name: 'Enterprise',
    price: 99,
    limits: { prompts: -1, storage: '500GB', projects: -1 }
  }
};
```

### Automatic Billing and Upgrades
Claude helped implement webhook handling for subscription management:

```typescript
// Stripe webhook handler with Claude's assistance
export async function handleStripeWebhook(event: Stripe.Event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
      await updateTeamSubscription(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'invoice.payment_succeeded':
      await trackPaymentSuccess(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
      await handleSubscriptionCancellation(event.data.object);
      break;
  }
}
```

## 3. Performance Optimization & Deployment

### Perfect Lighthouse Scores Achievement
Working with Claude, we optimized for performance from day one:

**Image Optimization Strategy:**
```jsx
<!-- Optimized image loading with Claude's guidance -->
<picture>
  <source
    srcset={getCloudFrontUrl(image, { format: 'webp', width: 400 })}
    type="image/webp"
    media="(max-width: 640px)"
  />
  <source
    srcset={getCloudFrontUrl(image, { format: 'webp', width: 800 })}
    type="image/webp"
    media="(max-width: 1024px)"
  />
  <img
    src={getCloudFrontUrl(image, { format: 'jpeg', width: 800 })}
    alt={prompt.title}
    loading="lazy"
    class="w-full h-auto"
  />
</picture>
```

**Astro View Transitions:**
```jsx
<!-- Smooth gallery navigation with Claude's implementation -->
<a href={`/public/prompts/${prompt.id}`} 
   transition:name={`prompt-${prompt.id}`}
   class="prompt-link">
  <img transition:name={`image-${prompt.id}`} 
       src={prompt.thumbnail} 
       alt={prompt.title} />
</a>
```

### Production Deployment Architecture
Claude helped design a robust deployment strategy:

- **Frontend**: Netlify with automatic GitHub deployments
- **Backend**: PocketHost for PocketBase hosting  
- **Images**: AWS S3 + CloudFront for global CDN
- **Payments**: Stripe with webhook validation
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

## 4. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

### Real-time Documentation Generation
One of Claude's standout features was generating comprehensive documentation as we built:

**Architecture Documentation:**
- Database schema with relationships
- API endpoint specifications
- Component library documentation
- Deployment and environment setup guides

**Development Guides:**
- Setup instructions for new developers
- Testing strategies and workflows
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security best practices

**User Documentation:**
- Feature usage guides
- Subscription management
- Team collaboration workflows
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Living Codebase Knowledge
Claude maintained context across the entire 30-day development cycle, remembering architectural decisions, implementation patterns, and ongoing challenges. This created a "living knowledge base" that could:

- Explain complex architectural decisions
- Suggest improvements based on established patterns
- Identify potential issues before they became problems
- Provide consistent code quality across all features

- **Performance**: Optimization techniques applied consistently

**Traditional Development Estimate:** 3-4 months  
**Actual Development Time:** 30 days  
**Velocity Improvement:** 300-400%

### Code Quality Metrics
```typescript
// Example of Claude's consistent error handling pattern
export async function createPrompt(data: CreatePromptData): Promise<Prompt> {
  try {
    const prompt = await pb.collection('prompts').create(data);
    
    // Auto-generate activity log
    await logActivity({
      type: 'prompt_created',
      user: data.user,
      team: data.team,
      details: { promptId: prompt.id, title: data.title }
    });
    
    return prompt;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create prompt:', error);
    throw new Error('Unable to create prompt. Please try again.');
  }
}
```
