I'm excited to share the **March 2025 update** to **Midjourney Prompt Manager**, focused on refining the parameter controls, improving UI consistency, and giving creators deeper control over their visuals. Let's dig into what’s new!

## Midjourney Parameters: UI Logic and Feature Improvements

We've redesigned the Parameters panel to match Midjourney's own structure more closely, making it faster and more intuitive to craft powerful prompts.

### **1. Parameter Reordering & Grouping**
- **Aspect Ratio** and **Mode** now appear at the top of the left column.
- **Quality** remains left-aligned, while **Tile** has been moved to a more intuitive spot.
- **Stylization**, **Weirdness**, **Variety / Chaos (%)**, and the new **Speed** parameter are now grouped on the right.

### **2. Naming Consistency**
- “Style” is now labeled **Mode**, offering “Standard” and “Raw.”
- “Stylize” has been renamed **Stylization**.
- “Weirdness” and “Chaos” are now labeled clearly across the interface as **Weirdness** and **Variety / Chaos (%)**.

### **3. Expanded Tooltips**
- Each parameter now has a helpful tooltip icon.
- Tooltips are now displayed to the **right of the icon** for better visibility.
- Tooltips use a higher z-index to prevent overlap from nearby UI elements.

### **4. Incremental Precision**
- Stylization increments in steps of **50** (0–1000)
- Weirdness increments in **100s** (0–3000)
- Variety / Chaos now increments in **5%** steps (0–100)
- **Speed** defaults to Fast, and `--fast` is omitted from final prompt output if selected.

### **5. Improved Text Fields**
- Personalization (`--p`) and Negative Keywords (`--no`) fields now use a consistent `text-slate-900` style to ensure legibility.

### **6. Raw Mode Clarification**
- A new popup explains **Raw Mode** more clearly, including its compatibility with Midjourney v5.1 and beyond.

### **7. Speed Parameter**
- Added a selector for **Speed** with options: Fast (default), Relax, and Turbo.
- Relax or Turbo appear in the final prompt; Fast does not.

### **8. Logic Improvements**
- Excluded `--fast` from final output if selected.
- Added `speed` to the parameter loop to ensure correct prompt output when non-default speeds are selected.
