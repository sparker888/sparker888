## March Update: Parameter UI Enhancements, New Styling Upgrades, and Upcoming Beta Launch  
_Updated: March 31, 2025_

I'm excited to share the **March 2025 update** to **Midjourney Prompt Manager**, focused on refining the Midjourney Parameter UI, and giving creators more control over their visuals with additional Style Selections.

## First, Midjourney Parameter Selection UI Improvements

### **1. Parameter Reordering & Grouping**
- **Aspect Ratio** and **Mode** (used to be Style) now appear at the top of the left column. These selections are used more frequently than the model, so it made sense to place them up top. In addition, I've made **Standard** the default mode now, as it can be problematic for novices to use **Raw** if they don't know what they're doing.
- **Quality** remains left-aligned, and I have kept 1 as the default but continued to highlight that Quality 2 is available for the 6.1 model.
- **Stylization**, **Weirdness**, **Variety / Chaos (%)**, and the new **Speed** parameter are now grouped on the right.

### **2. Naming Consistency**
 - “Style” is now labeled **Mode**, offering “Standard” and “Raw” as they appear on Midjourney.
 - “Stylize” has been renamed **Stylization**, to be consistent with Midjourney.
 - While Midjourney has changed "Chaos" to “Variety,” I have kept it as **Variety / Chaos (%)** for better clarity—at least until they decide what to do with Chaos or change the use of `--chaos` as the parameter identifier.

### **3. Expanded Tooltips**
- **Mode**, **Stylization**, **Weirdness**, and **Variety / Chaos (%)** now have helpful tooltip icons to assist those new to working with Midjourney in understanding their function.
- Tooltips are now displayed to the **right of the icon** for better visibility.
- I'm looking at further improving them for the beta launch, but this works as a start.

### **4. Incremental Precision**
- **Stylization** was updated to increment in steps of **50** (0–1000).
- **Weirdness** was updated to increment in steps of **100** (0–3000).
- **Variety / Chaos (%)** was updated to increment in steps of **5%** (0–100).

### **5. Speed Option Added**
- I've added **Speed** to the Midjourney Parameters to give users control over this feature directly from Midjourney Prompt Manager.
- Relax or Turbo appear in the final prompt if selected; Otherwise, just ignore it for **Fast**, as it's the Midjourney default.
